# status
Serverless status page served from AWS S3 generated by sourcegraph/checkup
running in AWS Lambda

## Description

[Checkup](https://github.com/sourcegraph/checkup) is a tool for generating a
status page. It is able to store the generated status page directly to S3. By
running checks from a [scheduled Lambda
function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tutorial-scheduled-events-schedule-expressions.html),
we can have a serverless status page.

## Setup

Before running `terraform apply`, some dependencies need to be manually prepared.

### Checkup static files and configuration

Checkup's UI is comprised of the static files inside it's `statuspage`
directory. This repository includes Checkup as a submodule, so it's enough to
ensure you clone and initialise submodules:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yi-jiayu/status.git
```

If you have already cloned the repository, you can initialise the submodules
with:

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Checkup binary

The Checkup binary needs to be built as well. Since Checkup is not built with
Go modules yet, we will need to build it in our GOPATH instead of using our
submodule.

Since our executable will be run in Lambda, we will build it for Amazon Linux
with `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64`. We will also use `CGO_ENABLED=0` because we are
not using SQLite or other cgo dependencies.

```
go get github.com/sourcegraph/checkup
(cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sourcegraph/checkup/cmd/checkup && CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build)
mkdir -p layer/bin
cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/sourcegraph/checkup/cmd/checkup/checkup layer/bin/
```
